# A star pathfinding Demo
## Updates:
1. Implemented a Priority Queue based on Binary Heap
2. Added code to find the closest target from a list of targets and find path towards that target using A star algorithm
3. Added movement interface for the player represented by capsule
4. Improved game assets
5. Improved player movement by changing heuristic to Manhattan distance to smoothen the player movements.
6. Implemented automatic pathfollowing with Euclidean distance as measure to find closest target.
7. Added NavMesh to bake the scene
8. Created NavMeshAgent to navigate through the scene
9. Designed Animator for player movement
10. Added Planning scene into the game (doesn't implement the plan yet)

### Planning Scene
![Planning Scene]()

## Work to be done before Milestone 1:
1. ~~Improve assets, look and feel~~
2. ~~Add logic for automated player movement to the selected target~~
3. Add different types of targets like Drawers, Safe, Alarm-based locks.
4. Improve automatic pathfollowing by replacing Euclidean distance to fscore as measure to find closest target.
5. ~~Add scene for Planning the Heist~~
